As a thermal monitoring service, I need to read CPU and GPU thermal zone temperatures and log timestamps to ensure the device stays within safe limits.
As an embedded developer, I want register-level access with retries and error codes for invalid parameters and timeouts.
As a safety engineer, I need redundant components with heartbeat checks and immediate failover.
As a QA lead, I want boundary tests for input validation and clear error messages for negative scenarios.
As a product manager, I need performance metrics captured alongside functional test generation for reports.
