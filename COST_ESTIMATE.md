## Total Cost Estimate (INR)

| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|----------|-------------:|--------------:|
| Development | ₹1,85,000 | ₹4,30,000 |
| Infrastructure (First Year) | ₹1,15,200 | ₹3,36,000 |

### Projected Revenue (First Year)

| Scenario | Customers | MRR (₹) | Annual Revenue (₹) |
|----------|----------:|--------:|-------------------:|
| Conservative | 20 | 1,00,000 | 12,00,000 |
| Expected | 50 | 2,50,000 | 30,00,000 |
| Optimistic | 100 | 5,00,000 | 60,00,000 |

### Profit Margin Calculation (First Year)

| Scenario | Revenue (₹) | Costs (₹) | Gross Profit (₹) | Profit Margin |
|----------|------------:|----------:|-----------------:|--------------:|
| Conservative | 12,00,000 | 8,41,000 | 3,59,000 | 29.9% |
| Expected | 30,00,000 | 8,41,000 | 21,59,000 | 72.0% |

### Break-Even Analysis
- **Monthly Expenses**: ~₹70,000 (including development amortization)
- **Break-even Point**: 5-15 paying customers (Professional Plan)
- **Time to Break-even**: 4-8 months

### Growth Projections (3 Years)

| Year | Customers | Revenue (₹) | Costs (₹) | Profit (₹) | Margin |
|-----:|----------:|------------:|----------:|-----------:|-------:|
| 1 | 50 | 30,00,000 | 8,41,000 | 21,59,000 | 72.0% |

### Key Profit Drivers
1. **High Gross Margins**: 70-90% after initial development
2. **Recurring Revenue**: Subscription model ensures steady cash flow
3. **Low Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: ~₹25,000-50,000 per customer
4. **High Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: ~₹3-5L over 3 years

### Risk Factors
- Competition from open-source alternatives
- Customer churn if value not demonstrated
- AI API cost fluctuations
- Security and compliance requirements

## Assumptions
- Exchange rate: $1 = ₹83 (as of Sep 2025)
